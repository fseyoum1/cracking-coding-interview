Big O time is the language and metric we use to describe the efficiency of an algorithms.

Time complexity: Imagine sending a tera byte file using an electronic transfer vs delivering it via a plan to California
from Georgia. Sending it through plan would take lets say one day. while sending using an electronic transfer it could ta
ke more than a day b/s the file is too big.
Time Complexity:
Electronic Transfer --> O(s) where s is the size of the file. means time to transfer the file increases with the size.
Airplane Transfer --> O(1) no matter how big the size of the file is it won't take any longer than one day. Even if the
increases the time it take is constant.
